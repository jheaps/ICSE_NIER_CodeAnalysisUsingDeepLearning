\section{Introduction}

The static analysis of source code is performed for many reasons, such as bug detection, security analysis, quality assurance, and more. Many static analysis tools and algorithms exist to assist in detection tasks on source code. However, the manual production of such tools and algorithms can be quite costly in time and money, and are prone to software bugs and human error. 

To solve these problems, we propose to use deep learning techniques to perform static analysis on source code.

To our knowledge we are the first to perform deep learning techniques on source code.

%TODO: I'm not 100% sure what to say or describe here. Should we discuss PAM at all? I know the word embeddings and deep learning analysis on source code in general is the real focus. I'm not sure how to fully turn it into an introduction...
