\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

We have described a novel approach to utilize deep learning techniques to assist in the analysis of source code. A process for translating words in source code to word embeddings to be usable as input has been detailed. Evaluations to determine the effectiveness and feasability of the techniques have also been explained.

Besides providing semantics support to static analysis tools, our approach may enable and lead to a large variety of research projects and techniques in software engineering. First, the mapping from code elements to high level concepts can help developers better understand their code by automatically adding comments and commit messages, or by retrieving relevant code in code search. Second, such an automatically generated mappings may facilitate the reuse of code and patterns across project boundary, because they provide an intermediate point (i.e., textual keywords representing high level concepts) to map code elements from different projects. Third, nowadays software are used more and more common in various embedded environments (e.g., smart cars, medical devices), and they need to follow privacy and safety regulations in the the areas. The mapping is able to link high level concepts in the regulations to concrete code, and thus enable automatic enforcement of regulations for embedded software.
